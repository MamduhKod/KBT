This is a simple app which creates a behavioral experiment, with the following functionality:

The user should be able to define a behavioral experiment for challenging a thought. After performing the thought, the user can go back to to the home page and record the results of the experiments, and get a report on wether the belief in the thought has increased or decreased. 

The user should be able to see both plans and finished experiments from the home page, and should also be able to delete the plans or results continually.
